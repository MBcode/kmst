-might still use protege, or at lease SemanticMediaWiki+ from KM, or (Power)LOOM web interface
  less of ML focus, and more about getting descriptions of things in quickly for any reasoning need.
-
 then on the mapping from slightly different description hierarchies(once they are determined).
  really should look at descriptions to be used, and tool up just enough to get them going.
might make a kmst km semantic things; can show mapping example when needed; romilly.co.uk sed..  
 could use ini file parser like: http://www.cliki.net/clinicap &several others, but really
  look at how many need to be parsed in near&further terms.  -just get this device-descrp going &..
 want tree to triple translation now;see P S O, at start, w/P O pairs w/in the {}s
 could use: http://www.cliki.net/trivial-configuration-parser too
   works, after some transformation; look at transforms&other parsing, to meet in middle
 
will also look at cl-kb or similar, to pull in protege pont/pins files ;eg. w/xml-tab imports
 can just take xml in directly though

 also github.com/percyliang/sempre.git  ;framenet many uses incl train-set4finding relations
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Semantic_Web ;found km component-lib framenet sumo connection
 want ability to describe event relationships&more, but need (problem) descriptions
Bring over more from kmp, but can still do some early dev there 1st. Tools&some gen-structure..km
ModelBased(actors)for:semantic-service composition,monitoring,diagnosis,&repair suggestions.
Want data(cube)info aligned w/the(sumo like)component-lib of KM;Start rough&cleanUp,in all directions
http://semstats.org/

get,pd: lparallel,lfarm cl-p2p pcall stmx  ;distrib-blackboard,  linda(tuple) setup going
https://github.com/naveensundarg/RLCNL  could be used &/or km bits, to have ~NL output
 found other planner/constriant /pd:csp etc too
pick&try any simple com/above sockets, could also use ccl or cmucl, &try:
 http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~ljosa/doc/encycmuclopedia/devenv/cmu-user/ipc.html
    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/clisp/src/exp/struct/code/remote.lisp 
also consider slime/swank, as remote dbg will also be needed
also http://www.cliki.net/websocket%20server https://github.com/spratt/cl-websocket.git
on osx updated sbcl 1.1[8->16] &got update of: https://github.com/aaltodsg/instans.git 
 and finally got a clean command-line binary
Usage: instans [ -h | --help | -v | --version | { <configuration-option> } ]

General options:
-h | --help                             Print this message and exit.
-v | --version                          Print version information and exit.

Configuration options:
-n <string>   | --name <string>         Use <string> as the name of the system.
-d <dir>      | --directory <dir>       Use <dir> as the prefix for file lookup.
                                        You can use a file or an URL as <dir>
-b <url>      | --base <url>            Use <url> as the base.
-g <graph>    | --graph <graph>         If <graph> is 'default' add the following 
                                        inputs to the default graph. If it is <url>
                                        add them to the graph named by <url>
-r <rules>    | --rules <rules>         Use rules in <rules>.
-i <input>    | --input <input>         Read input based on <input>.
-t <input>    | --triples <input>       Same as -i.
-o <output>   | --output <output>       Write output based on <output>.
-e <expect>   | --expect <expect>       Compare the results to <expect>.
-f <commands> | --file <commands>       Read options from <commands>.
--report <rules>                        The kinds of rules you want to get reported; a ':'
                                        separated list of (select|construct|modify).
--triple-processing-policy <policy>     See the documentation.
--rule-instance-removal-policy <policy> See the documentation.
--rete-html-page-dir <dir>              Create an HTML page about the Rete network.
--queue-execution-policy <policy>       See the documentation.
-e            | --execute               Execute the system. This is done by default at the end of processing all arguments.
--debug <phases>                        See the documentation.
--verbose <phases>                      Same ase --debug.

See the documentation for description of the parameters of the options above

=having a streaming sparql engine should be really useful, to deal w/~RT updates
http://www.cs.hut.fi/~mjrinne/documents/INSTANS%2011102013.pdf 
added link to sparql11-test-suite while changing hard coded test links
Get instans <-> km interop, ~like the kmp km rdf/owl/etc interop
 having streaming sparql queries, and other KM reasoning together could be great
 also just try KM's: 29.8 Forward Chaining on Slots, &see about starting w/just instans I/O
 curious why instans rules done w/: rete/rete-classes.lisp &not reuse lisa.sf.net work
=will also look at: http://trac.common-lisp.net/isidorus/wiki/TmSparql 
=and https://github.com/mtravers/swframes had tried BioLisp/BioBike before
In kmp started to look at krss2 loads, continue here;
 (define-primitive-concept a b) -> (a has (superclasses (b)))
 (define-primitive-role a ::parents(b)) -> (a has (superclasses (b))) ;where top class is (Slot)
inputs from:.. nlp2rdf.org also trying: stack.lod2.eu/blog notional.no-ip.org/srv.html
DataRobot Automated Predictive Modeling http://bit.ly/1sFwb65 more kmp, but aiding etl/srvc compose  
Still interested in the above, but less from some of the IoT buzz uses, &more for some of the
 longer view use of semantics(KnRep&Reasoning)to aid KnBased(eg.scietific)endevour.
General shared standards are still a focus, but getting thigs working w/in their spheres w/the
 best most flexible tech(where one can still explore),is still a focus.  Still have interest in
 things like common-logic as well, as some cNL &much more. Want to knock out a lil in the area soon.

Slides on "Dataverse with DataTags: Sharing Data you can't Share" presented with @michbarsinai at iRODS Meeting @IQSS http://owl.li/yxkh1  
also: http://datascience.iq.harvard.edu/presentations/data-publishing-workflows-dataverse ...
iRODS uses rules for data-store, this sci data store/share metadata not necc w3c stnd
also looking@ distrib file sys, w/meta-data, incl: coda, ceph, glusterfs, openafs, ...
want meta-fs, w/offline cache, file&s3 like interact,...

Lots of interesting presentations to read in more details: workshop on #imaging ontology http://ncorwiki.buffalo.edu/index.php/Ontology_and_Imaging_Informatics … via @cekahn 
really do want data-cube/etc to annotae sci data, maybe w/kmp &hdf part of cl-ana/?
 =https://github.com/ghollisjr/cl-ana  has hdf-table,&much more for data-analysis
 a few more semantic-stats links, could start w/something simple /even w/just data-tables


 Dean Wampler ‏@deanwampler  ;might help pick distrib-filestore; get RRDs on ceph too?
Tachyon near-term roadmap: Ceph integration (Redhat), Hierarchical Local Storage (Intel), Improve Shark perf. (Yahoo), others. #sparksummit

look into a lisp openrefine client, similar to: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/refine-client
also at beautiful-soup equivalents/or connectors/etc.
