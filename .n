-might still use protege, or at lease SemanticMediaWiki+ from KM, or (Power)LOOM web interface
  less of ML focus, and more about getting descriptions of things in quickly for any reasoning need.
-
Still want protege w/lsw2, have a cache of svn.mumble.net:8080 &old email on getting abcl lisp up w/it, but not working.

@MarkusLanthaler  Quite exciting to see TensorFlow, @Google's machine learning system, being open-sourced http://bit.ly/1PlmLtE ;nn&nice workflow-viz 

 Algernon(tab) is useful, but would be nicer w/full lisp; Think there is a clojure-tab around; still want stnd lisp/km.
-
 then on the mapping from slightly different description hierarchies(once they are determined).
  really should look at descriptions to be used, and tool up just enough to get them going.
might make a kmst km semantic things; can show mapping example when needed; romilly.co.uk sed..  
 could use ini file parser like: http://www.cliki.net/clinicap &several others, but really
  look at how many need to be parsed in near&further terms.  -just get this device-descrp going &..
 want tree to triple translation now;see P S O, at start, w/P O pairs w/in the {}s
 could use: http://www.cliki.net/trivial-configuration-parser too
   works, after some transformation; look at transforms&other parsing, to meet in middle
 
will also look at cl-kb or similar, to pull in protege pont/pins files ;eg. w/xml-tab imports
 can just take xml in directly though

Usage: instans [ -h | --help | -v | --version | { <configuration-option> } ]

General options:
-h | --help                             Print this message and exit.
-v | --version                          Print version information and exit.

Configuration options:
-n <string>   | --name <string>         Use <string> as the name of the system.
-d <dir>      | --directory <dir>       Use <dir> as the prefix for file lookup.
                                        You can use a file or an URL as <dir>
-b <url>      | --base <url>            Use <url> as the base.
-g <graph>    | --graph <graph>         If <graph> is 'default' add the following 
                                        inputs to the default graph. If it is <url>
                                        add them to the graph named by <url>
-r <rules>    | --rules <rules>         Use rules in <rules>.
-i <input>    | --input <input>         Read input based on <input>.
-t <input>    | --triples <input>       Same as -i.

=having a streaming sparql engine should be really useful, to deal w/~RT updates

added link to sparql11-test-suite while changing hard coded test links
Get instans <-> km interop, ~like the kmp km rdf/owl/etc interop
 having streaming sparql queries, and other KM reasoning together could be great
 also just try KM's: 29.8 Forward Chaining on Slots, &see about starting w/just instans I/O
 curious why instans rules done w/: rete/rete-classes.lisp &not reuse lisa.sf.net work
=will also look at: http://trac.common-lisp.net/isidorus/wiki/TmSparql 
=and https://github.com/mtravers/swframes had tried BioLisp/BioBike before
In kmp started to look at krss2 loads, continue here;
 (define-primitive-concept a b) -> (a has (superclasses (b)))
 (define-primitive-role a ::parents(b)) -> (a has (superclasses (b))) ;where top class is (Slot)

DataRobot Automated Predictive Modeling http://bit.ly/1sFwb65 more kmp, but aiding etl/srvc compose  
Still interested in the above, but less from some of the IoT buzz uses, &more for some of the
 longer view use of semantics(KnRep&Reasoning)to aid KnBased(eg.scietific)endevour.
General shared standards are still a focus, but getting thigs working w/in their spheres w/the
 best most flexible tech(where one can still explore),is still a focus.  Still have interest in
 things like common-logic as well, as some cNL &much more. Want to knock out a lil in the area soon.

    To me, it looks like @googleresearch either: 
    a) is ignorant of what #AutoML really is and doesn't know better, or 
    b) is choosing to exploit a trending research field by naming one of their cloud products after it.  
    Disappointing either way.
 Google's "AutoML" currently performs #DeepLearning architecture search for image data.  
 #AutoML as a field covers much more than that, e.g., one list of AutoML goals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning … #MachineLearning

Also to incl: when advising:
Any software prototypes created for this project may utilize software tools
and/or design code that the advisor has created independently of this project and/or which is intended to be
used by advisor in other capacities. Therefore, while the company will own the customized instantiation of
the prototype, the advisor retains the ownership in the underlying software tools and design code. The
software prototype is not intended for production or “off the shelf” use and is provided for design purposes
only.

we got an amazon-echo, tried it's sdk(too much just to play on my laptop)unless I missed the short version;so went through a long list of TTS,incl: mycroft,..
 https://github.com/Fizzixnerd/cl-sphinx.git .. &during that found this repo w/a number of interesting pkgs:
  https://github.com/belambert/ cl-asr.git ..  cl-pos-tagger, cl-dependency-lm, cl-language-model & cl-machine-learning ;missing blambert-utils, but found
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~belamber/ &have written&he should be able to find them; Looks like interesting work/code/pubs, look fwd to perusing some more.
    Noticed he had used Fahlman's SCONE, which I looked@while @ucsf.edu, &worked w/Dan Roth(who I missed overlapping w/);&was@amherst,liked prev ai/lisp work.
   will also look@belambert's py work,mycroft,&others(though might lisp/hylang wrap some of it, to play w/).
  got belambert-utils, still (at least) need cl-optimization/cl-lm 4ML& misc dir for models
  cl-lm was just learning-models under diff name, tried a pos-mapping in misc but wrong format; so no lm or maxent yet;have other notes on fixes

-would have used scone/instans if I knew they were openly available much earlier.  I see scone (base) is open now too:

@csarven : @linkedktk Other vocabs possibly for details. @nimonika created https://w3id.org/dio  & that looks like the layer I want to describe in. 
The Design Intent Ontology - A content ontology design pattern : is a generic ontology that provides the conceptualisation needed to capture the knowledge generated during various phases of the overall design lifecycle. It provides definitions for design artifacts such as requirements, designs, design issues, solutions, justifications and evidence and relationships between them to represent the design process and how these things lead to design outcomes. It draws upon the paradigms of IBIS(Issue Based Information System), argumentation and design rationale.

Spent weekend going through years of backup drives&consolidating, incl getting rid of several HFS+ partitions; ext4 is fine for backup

@Miel_vds My slides on 'Reproducibility with the 99 cents #linkeddata archive’ available here:  http://bit.ly/2mb9Dg7  #openbelgium

Linux tool: http://ranger.nongnu.org/ w/w3m(-ing)&poppler-utils, allows cmndline viewing of even htm&pdf-text
 uses my fav multi pane directory viewing, but then much more, &w/vi key bindings; it will get a lot of use.
_I got the atom editor working in a single chome(os)tab w/xiwi;might still use, but ranger has more(overall)use.
 thunderbird works in a chrome-tab; turns out sdiff is much faster than 'meld' though less pretty, in instances
 protege&powerloom didn't start in a tab as well, &webpage server not coming up right away either
 plm:ontosaurus runs, &can startxfce4 for protege; maybe web/v3 applet2
 java_home was just reset so have protege w/in a chrome tab vs going to xfce4
 if I (start-powerloom-server) also get the java-gui: xiwi -T plm;but didn't load non toy kb even w/4x of Xmx256m,get soap errors
Past days of travel(now w/o cnct2home cluster)&neither commits from pixel, public|private are ending up on my github weekly graph:(
Back2cluster, maybe this update will finally show up&when time I can track this down; also someday look@gitlab /etc.
 still bothered by some commits not showing up

Like JuPyteR notebook, but very simple annotated html w/uri-s for all by ref calls, could incl arrays as img data w/xmp metadata, so could see those args.
Use sw onto(theswo.sf.net) to describe JuPyteR etc computational components _instantiate and be able2run
 nice in that both 1plc to search for functionality and might be able to focus on fnc vs form
_something like web-protege(w/old tabs)along w/web-Rstudio would be nice;knime/etc wf too/?
What simple bit of magic would allow easier x-lang use; incl apache arrow's feather,scidb,...
 maybe a notebook using ipynb like use of json-ld, w/refs2the larger shared bits,still easily load/used by each lang.
revisiting sagemath.org which has a jupyter front end, a much wider variety of math capabilities beneth it; lots of py/R,&lisp
Might be easier to continue w/this1jupyter kernal that has a few w/in: https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/#runningsos ;but still not smooth
Still RStudio w/rPython JuliaCall  then snow &/or some (rest)rpc ?  ;rPython to sage would still be nice
Maybe back2wf w/prov, like: yesworkflow ..    also try: sage/etc w/public https://cocalc.com/ 1st

Data Science @dtscnc We should return to the literal meaning of "semantic publishing" by letting scientists themselves represent and publish their results in a semantic notation, argue Tobias Kuhn (@txkuhn) and Michel Dumontier (@micheldumontier) in their position paper: https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-170010 …

@essepuntato 28 Dec 2017 Thinking a scholarly article as a complex biological system: one of the main points discussed in my #openaccess article “Automating Semantic Publishing” recently published as part of the inaugural issue of @dtscnc by @IOSPress_STM - https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-170012 … #SemPub #datascience

Data Science @dtscnc Feb 19 We can automatically and gradually build semantic information from scientific papers starting from low-level syntactic elements in a markup language like HTML, with minimal additional effort by authors, argues Silvio Peroni (@essepuntato) in Data Science: https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-170012 …
