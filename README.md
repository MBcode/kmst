a focus from kmp to semantic-things ;things w/meaning  
=== kmp was:

KM+Protege.stanford.edu  (www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/km)

Get Protege3.5, jess-tab jess.jar(for now),Start it then: project-&gt configure to select jesstab
batch load https://github.com/MBcode/CLIPSmsc/blob/master/jutl.clp for a few lisp like utils

-might still use protege, or at lease SemanticMediaWiki+ from KM, or (Power)LOOM web interface
  less of ML focus, and more about getting descriptions of things in quickly for any reasoning need.

One of the MachineLearning pprj I use in (cl-)kme uses protege, and I could store/display/edit
 other(km)constructs w/it, incl maybe some other basic (lisp)code;  

Algernon(tab)uses a lisp and is very KM like; I've heard from the lsw2 people abcl can be used.
alg-tab also has a server.  Really just playing right now.

Can load arff and have mlcl (machine-learning+(protege)KnowledgeAcquisition)
Can load owl file/s like those in the LUBM benchmarks, which I mention in: http://bit.ly/TP8gfz
Trial loading of a ttl file for data-cube data:
https://code.google.com/p/publishing-statistical-data/source/browse/trunk/specs/src/main/vocab/cube.ttl?r=180
So, moving toward better self described (numeric)data-sets, that can be used by a variety of learners

http://lispinsummerprojects.org/ started in kme then cl-kme then some of that ended up here /too

Made http://cliki.net/machine%20learning and plan further work, here and elsewhere.
